PairTools is a Vim plugin to manage auto-close pairs with basic surround abilities.

See the plugin accompanying help file for more information.

There are now two ways to install this plugin

1. The hard way:
    Manually copy plugin/pairtools.vim into your plugin directory.
    Manually copy doc/pairtools.txt into your doc directory.
    Run helptags on 'your/user/path/to/doc'

2. The easy way:
    For Windows users you can run setup.bat
    For Unix, Linux, MacOS X, you can run setup.pl (Not fully tested.)

    The installation script can take zero or one argument.
    - When no argument is passed, the script will use %USERPROFILE%\vimfiles under Windows, and 
    $HOME/.vim under Unix.
    - When an argument is passed, it must be the full path, either absolute or relative, to the
    installation directory. However, the plugin and doc folders must already exist inside this
    directory.
    
    It will automatically copy all files and run a vim session to call helptags on the 
    'your/vim/files/path/to/doc' folder and quit.
