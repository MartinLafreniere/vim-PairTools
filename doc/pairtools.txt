==============================================================================
1. Introduction											*pairtools-intro*

The PairTools plugin can be seen as a "bundle" of tools to handle various
"pair" operations. It also offers a flexible way to set pairs and options per
filetypes. Therefore, it is possible to have pairs and options set for editing 
C++ files while also editing XML files with other pairs and options inside the
same window.

The plugin is modular, i.e. related features are grouped inside a module, and 
other related features inside others groups. In the current version, there are 
three modules: pairclamp.vim, tagwrench.vim and jigsaw.vim.

The PairClamp module works with single characters pairs such as (,). The
TagWrench module works with angle brackets <,> and tags <tagname>. The Jigsaw
module coordinates some key maps between PairClamp and TagWrench, such as when
pressing backspace and calling the right hook function. The pairtools.vim file 
defines autocmds, mappings and options to make all the modules work.

Filetypes

The plugin work with {filetype}.vim files inside the user ftplugin/ directory
to setup itself inside the current buffers. For example, the user needs to
specify all the options he wants to enable for HTML editing; he must do so 
inside his ftplugin/html.vim. If that user also edits PHP file then he must
also specify a ftplugin/php.vim file with his options set for PHP.

There is a command tool to generate a {filetype}.vim file into ~\.vim or
~/vimfiles. Type :PairToolsSampleFile <filetype> to generate a sample file.
Example: >
	
	PairToolsSampleFile python
<
This will generate a python.vim file with all options in ~/.vim or ~\vimfiles
and all the user has to do is to copy the file inside the appropriate ftplugin
directory and modify the options value. For more flexibility, the user can set
the g:pairtools_samplefile_path variable from his .vimrc to specify the 
destination path for the generated files. 

Report

The plugin feature a simple "report" command. Type :PairToolsReport and it
will show all options value.


Note: Version 1.0 included a surround feature now removed. The user is 
      encouraged to use the surround plugin for vim instead.

==============================================================================
2. PairClamp											*pairtools-pairclamp*

The PairClamp module handle all operations involving single character pairs.
This include auto-closing a pair, stepping out from a pair, forcing a pair,
defining when a pair should not auto-close, erasing them with one key and
expanding then with carriage return.

To enable PairClamp, the user must provide inside his ftplugin/{filetype}.vim
the following: >
	
	let g:pairtools_{filetype}_pairclamp = 1
<

2.1 Auto-Close											*pairclamp-autoclose*

In order to use that feature, the user must enable it and specify which pairs
he wants to work with. To do so he must set these options into his filetype
file. For example, to set these options for Python the user needs to add this
into his ftplugin/python.vim: >

	let g:pairtools_python_autoclose  = 1
    let g:pairtools_python_closepairs = '(:),[:],":"'

This will enable the auto-closing feature and set the pairs (),{},[],''. Now
the user only need to have a file with filetype set to python and when he will
type the opening character of the pairs, that is a ( for a () pairs, then the
plugin will automatically add a closing character, thus ) in the forementioned
example. Basically the steps go like this (the | denotes the cursor):

	Type opening char:		(|
	Plugin adds closing:	(|)

Thus, the pair is automatically closed, AND the cursor is kept right after the
opening character. Now let's write something inside these parens:

	Type Hello World:		(Hello World|)
    Press ) next to the ):  (Hello World)|

Now when the user press the closing character when next to (and left of) the
closing character, it will automatically push the cursor on the right of it.

2.2 Force Pairs											*pairclamp-forcepairs*

Sometimes, it is useful to be able to force a pair to automatically close. For
example, the antimagic feature will prevent auto-closing inside some syntax
area. If the users really needs to add a pair and start editing in-between
them, this will allow the user to do so. This is really useful to add Python
DOCSTRING and immediatly start writing inside the DOCSTRING.

For example, to enable the force pairs for python, the user must add this to 
his python.vim file: >

	let g:pairtools_python_forcepairs = 1
<
Continuing on this example, the feature will use all the pairs set inside the
g:pairtools_python_closepairs and will map them with the META key (ALT key).
So for example, the double quote defined inside ftplugin/python.vim will have a
corresponding force pairs map at <M-">.

There is one notable exception to this and this is the bar |, which cannot be
mapping to the META key and instead uses <C-L>|.

The following example shows how this can be applied to python DOCSTRING:

	Type opening char ":		"|"

Typing " would only get the user out! Thus using force pairs by pressing <M-">
will yield to:

	Type <M-">:                 ""|""
    Type <M-"> again:		    """|"""

Then the user can type his text and then pressing " three times will get him
out.

2.3 Smart Close											*pairclamp-smartclose*

This feature can prevent auto-closing in some situations. These situations are
specified using a list of regex-like expressions. The user has to enable the
feature and specify in which condition to prevent auto-closing. For example,
let's say the user wants to prevents auto-closing when left of a word
character and opening parens inside his ftplugin/python.vim: >

	let g:pairtools_python_smartclose = 1
	let g:pairtools_python_smartcloserules = '\w,('
<
In smartcloserules, the \w represent any word character.

There is also the special character ^ which means all opening character
defined inside g:pairtools_{filetype}_closepairs. So, if there user has the
following closepairs set in his python.vim: >

	let g:pairtools_python_closepairs = '(:),[:],":"'
	let g:pairtools_python_smartcloserule = '\w,^'
<
Then the smartcloserule list can be considered to be '\w,(,[,"'. As rules are
are using as regex-like expression, it is important to escape the following 
characters: \*, \., \$ and \^.

2.4 Antimagic											*pairclamp-antimagic*

The antimagic feature allows to define syntax areas as antimagic fields, where
pairclamp auto-closing "magic" is prevented. To enable antimagic and set
syntax areas to prevent the magic the user need, for example in his python
file, add the following: >

	let g:pairtools_python_antimagic = 1
	let g:pairtools_python_antimagicfield = "Comment,String,Special"

This will prevent auto-close inside comments, strings and special areas.

2.5 Eraser												*pairclamp-eraser*

This feature allows to erase a whole pair using the backspace key. Using the
python example, the user can enable it using: >

	let g:pairtools_python_pceraser = 1
<
Then when the cursor is immediatly between the opening and closing character,
pressing backspace will automatically erase the closing character as well.
Example:

	We have this:			(Hello World|)
    Backspacing till (:		(|)
    One more backspace:		|

2.6 Expander											*pairclamp-expander*

The expander work when the carriage return key is hit when in-between
characters forming a pair. Using the python filetype as earlier, one can
enable this feature as follow: >

	let g:pairtools_python_pcexpander = 1
<
This will produce the following action:

	Let say you have this:		def somefunction(|)

	Pressing enter:				def somefunction(
                                    |
                                )

The user can see this action as follow: it presses enter, then tab for
indentation, then a second enter and finally put back the cursor on the
indentation.

==============================================================================
3. TagWrench											*pairtools-tagwrench*

This module is dedicated to the angle brackets <,> and tags formed by them.
Using the angle brackets pair inside PairClamp can lead to very confusing
situations and lot's of deletes. After all, these are used as lesser-something
and greater-something operators in many languages. And it's even more worse
when the user must used them inside html with for example php code embedded.

TagWrench resolve this by creating a "tag context" to avoid closing an opening
angle bracket when it is not necessary. Furthermore, the addition of hooks
allows to automatically add a closing tag when the first tag made with the 
angle brackets is a starting tag. More details will follow about this feature
later.

It is easier to grasp these features using VIM code and HTML code examples.
For now we will not use any hook, i.e. the options to set the TagWrench hook
will be set to a void hook. Here is an example of VIM script options the user 
can set to enable tagwrench with a void hook: >

	let g:pairtools_vim_tagwrench = 1
	let g:pairtools_vim_tagwrenchhook = 'tagwrench#BuiltinNoHook'
<
The tagwrench#BuiltinNoHook is a hook function defined inside the TagWrench
module that does nothing. It is useful when the user does not want to use any
of the provided hooks.

In Vim, when the user wants to map a key to do something special for the 
current buffer, he must use the "tag" <buffer>. Here is how it is constructed 
with the angle brackets:

	Type opening bracket:		<|
    Then type 'b':              <b|>

After the b appeared, the closing brackets is inserted. It will do so when the
first character is: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _, ! and /. There are two other characters 
as well but we will talk about them later.

	Type the remaining letter:  <buffer|>
    Press >:                    <buffer>|

The cursor stepped out like it is doing in PairClamp. It is that simple. But
much more can be done when using TagWrench to write HTML tags for example.
There are a few thing to consider while typing and moving the cursor in insert
mode. This requires an explanation on how it internally works, the big 
picture.

When the user type < for the first time, it starts a tag context and will
listen for a tag event. The following character typed will determine if we 
stay in the tag context or if we leave it. The context will automatically 
close when pressing > to step out of the "tag". But what happens when ESC, UP, 
DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT keys are pressed? 

ESC, UP an DOWN automatically leave the context leaving the tag as is. This is 
very important when using a hook along this feature because if the cursor is 
moved back left of the > in insert move, the context does not exist anymore. 
It will not step out of the tag and it will not call the hook function for 
futher processing anymore. And it is also true for LEFT and RIGHT keys,
but under some condition the context will not be left by pressing them.

The LEFT and RIGHT key are somewhat special. They don't automatically close 
the context, unless pressing RIGHT moved the cursor pass the > or pressing 
LEFT moved the cursor pass the <. This is an example of how LEFT, RIGHT works 
inside a tag context:

	Starting with:              <buffer|>
    Move with LEFT key:			<buffe|r>

In that case the context is kept since the cursor is still inside the pair.

   Starting with:               <buffer|>
   Move with RIGHT key:         <buffer>|

There the context is lost, no hook is called and putting the cursor left of
the > will not allow step out/hook call. Is is also valid for the <.

For now, we will come back to the two special characters we have mentioned
before. These two are the % and ? used to embed another language code inside
an html document, such as PHP code.

	Type the opening <:		    <|
	Type ?:                     <?|?>

And the context immediatly ends.

3.1 Hooks												*tagwrench-hooks*

The power of this module resides in the hook functions. When pressing the 
closing angle bracket to step out, the specified hook function is called for 
further processing. As we saw earlier a hook can be set as follow. The example
show how it can be set for an html filetype: >

	let g:pairtools_html_tagwrenchhook = 'tagwrench#BuiltinBasicTagHook'
<
Currently there are three builtin hooks:

tagwrench#BuiltinNoHook: 

This is the void hook, which does nothing and returns.

tagwrench#BuiltinBasicTagHook:

This is a basic tag builder that automatically add an ending tag when the 
starting tag does not end with />, i.e. it ends with a single >. Also, tags 
starting with a bang (!) or slash (/) never generate closing tags.

Here is an example using the <html> tag:

	We have:                   <html|>
    Pressing > produces:       <html>|</html>

	We have:                   <html /|>
	Pressing > produces:       <html />|

	We have:				   </html|>
	Pressing > produces:       </html>|

There is also another nice feature built inside the basic tag hook. It is a
kind of surrounding. For example, the user has the following line inside a
file, and wants to add tags around it:

	We have:                   Hello World
	We want:                   <h1>Hello World</h1>

This is quite simple, start adding the starting tag at the beginning of the
line, and an input will automatically show up in the command line when
pressing > because something is present right of the >:

	We type:                  <h1|>Hello World

The command line shows up, and a few things can be set:

	- $				At end of line
	- {count}l		{count} character(s) on the right
	- {count}w		{count} word(s) on the right (match end of words)
	- {count}W		{count} WORD(s) one the right (match end of WORDs)
	- t             Around tag name, second input shows up for tag name
	- /             Prevent closing tag
	- Nothing		That is, just pressing enter, right after starting tag

For simplicity, we will add the closing tags on the end of line:

	We have:                 <h1|>Hello World
	Pressing >, $, Enter:    <h1>|Hello World</h1>

Then, we want to add a span element to Hello:

	Adding span to Hello:    <h1><span|>Hello World</h1>
	Pressing >, w, Enter:    <h1><span>|Hello</span> World</h1>

* Note: current this feature only work inside a single line.

tagwrench#BuiltinHTML5Hook:

It calls the BuiltinBasicTagHook, passing it a list of tags to do not insert 
an ending tag. It follows all the rules from the basic tag hook plus it looks 
to prevent the closing tags for HTML5 void tags.

For example:

	We have:                   <img src="image.png"|>
	Pressing > produces:       <img src="image.png">|

	We have:                   <div id="main"|>
    Pressing > produces:	   <div id="main">|</div>

TagWrench Hook Public API								*tagwrench-hookapi*

It is possible for the user to make its own hook function and set it as the
current filetype TagWrench hook using the TagWrench Hook Public API.

Remember that while in a tag context, pressing > left of the tag ending > will
automatically call the specified hook for further processing. The user can use
the public function tagwrench#AddHook() to insert another hook. This function
needs an arguments: the full name of the hook function.

The hook function must take at least two arguments:

	1. Context Begin: this is the position of the opening < on the line.
    2. Context End: this is the position after the closing > on the line.

The hook function returns nothing. For examples, the user is refered to the
TagWrench Hook Public API fold in autoload/tagwrench.vim for few examples.

The BuiltinBasicTagHook is the corner stone of the BuiltinHTML5Hook and can be
used by the user. The BuiltinBasicTagHook take the two arguments specified
earlier plus an optional arguments to specify which tag names do no trigger
any closing tags. The tag names are specified in a commas separated string
list. Example: "img,link,meta".

3.2 Eraser												*tagwrench-eraser*

The TagWrench eraser can delete either a single tag or a pair of starting and
ending tags, by pressing backspace. We will illustrate how it works with an
example:

	We have:                   <img src="blah.png">|
	Pressing backspace:        |

	We have:	               <div id="main">|</div>
    Pressing backspace:        |

	We have:                   <div id="main"></div>|
    Pressing backspace:        <div id="main">|
    Pressing backspace again:  |

3.3 Expander											*tagwrench-expander*

The TagWrench expander expand a starting and ending tag and the special <%,%> 
and <?,?> much the same way the PairClamp expander expands brackets. The
simple <,> is not expanded on carriage return.

For example:

	We have:                   <|>
	Pressing <CR>:             <
                               |>

	We have:                   <div></div>
    Pressing <CR>:             <div>
                                   |
                               </div>

	We have:                   <?|?>
	Pressing <CR>:             <?
                                   |
		                       ?>

==============================================================================
4. Jigsaw												*pairtools-jigsaw*

The Jigsaw module is the central part to make then erasers and expanders of
both PairClamp and TagWrench work altogether. Here, we use hook functions to 
tell these when a given key is pressed, such as <BS> and <CR>.

Jigsaw current defines two functions:

	1. jigsaw#Backspace: mapped to <BS>
	2. jigsaw#CarriageReturn: mapped to <CR>

When one of these function is called by pressing a key, it will look execute
the hook functions until one has executed. Then, the return value associated
with this hook is returned.

When no hook is executed, the function return its default key, that is <BS>
for Backspace and <CR> for CarriageReturn.

It is possible to add more function using their public hook API:

	1. jigsaw#AddBackspaceHook
	2. jigsaw#AddCarriageReturnHook

These functions need two arguments:
	
	1. The hook function name
	2. The hook return value

Right now, the hook functions do not take any argument, but that could change
later on.

For the PairClamp and TagWrench modules, for example, the eraser functions are
hook for jigsaw#Backspace.

==============================================================================
5. Installation											*pairtools-install*

There are a few ways to install the plugin:

1. Using `git clone` manually copy all files
2. Using `git clone` launch `vim pairtools.vba` followed by `:so %` and 
   `:quit`.
3. Download the vimball at www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3560 and
   follow 2.

==============================================================================
6. Filetype Files Examples								*pairtools-examples*

See the ftplugin/ files included in the github repository:
	
	https://github.com/MartinLafreniere/vim-PairTools/tree/master/ftplugin


==============================================================================
7. Few Thoughts											*pairtools-thoughts*

- Using the repeat command '.' with |auto-close| doesn't work as expected by a 
  user. The closing character will not appear even though the user type the
  ending character to step out of the pair.

- When including the double quotes in the closepairs option, starting a
  comment in VIM language file will result in an auto-closed pair.
